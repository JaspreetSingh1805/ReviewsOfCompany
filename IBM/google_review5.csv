Swasti Padhi,Food court is nice. The sitting areas are so fine. But what bugs me is that they are not maintaing the washrooms. Sometimes there is no tissue papers kept and washrooms are not cleaned properly. Till now I have never seen them keep sanitary pads in the washroom. Even the flush is not working. It's really pathetic.,4.5
